//TODO: Read through the OrderWatcher documentation and use it to implement order pruning

//TODO: Abstract the order creation code to work for any ERC20 token, or at least a much larger subset (current code just does ZRX <=> ETH)

//TODO:Error handling for "Error: Invalid JSON RPC response: " --- this means testRPC is not running ... lots of other error handling. at least its not super ugly since it only happens in the console not on frontend

//TODO: make it work with the real ethereum blockchain/metamask not just testrpc local test network
