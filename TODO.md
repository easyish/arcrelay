TODO.md


In index.ts:

//TODO: Read through the OrderWatcher documentation and use it to implement order pruning

//TODO Have create, sign, fill order functionality working through html page with amounts, token types, and addresses being input

//TODO: Abstract the order creation code to work for any ERC20 token, or at least a much larger subset (current code just does ZRX <=> ETH)

//TODO:Error handling for "Error: Invalid JSON RPC response: " --- this means testRPC is not running
